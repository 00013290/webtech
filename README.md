# Daily blog app

### This app is for creating blog posts about travelling and general daily activities
The project was built using Node.js and Express.js on the back-end, while the front-end was built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Pug was used as a templating engine.

To manage the project's dependencies, I used npm, and to store the blog data, I used a JSON file. Git and GitHub were used for version control, and I used VS Code as my primary code editor.

The project was developed in an iterative manner, starting with the basic structure and adding features and functionality as I went along. I tested the project thoroughly throughout the development process, and made sure that it was responsive and accessible on different devices.

Overall, I am pleased with how the project turned out, and I believe it showcases my skills and knowledge of web development.

### Project limitations
Application overall works well, although there is a bug with Delete function. It works, but shows an error that I tried to fix a lot.
